### Requirements
- Node.js (I used v18, but anything recent should work)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- A terminal/command prompt


### how to run

1. **Grab the code and navigate to it**
   ```bash
   cd 2261375
   ```

2. **Install the main service dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd "Backend Test Submission"
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install the logging middleware dependencies too**
   ```bash
   cd "../Logging Middleware"
   npm install
   cd "../Backend Test Submission"
   ```

4. **Fire it up!**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

You should see something like:
```
URL Shortener service running on port 3001
```

## Test

### A script
```bash
node test-script.js
```

This will run through all the main features and tell you if everything's working.
